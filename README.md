# SnakeGame

Hey there! Here's a python code for the very famous Nokia's Snake game (One of my childhood fav too) .
You can even have an A.I. model of the same!!!

At its roots, Snake borrows from a 1976 arcade game, called Blockade.
Distinctly similar to Snake, the game was designed for two players and couldn’t be played alone. 
In it, both the players would navigate their own snakes, leaving a solid line behind them. 
The line itself becomes a blockade for you, and the player who lasts longer on the board, wins.
Trying to play this game alone would be impossible, since the second player’s snake would simply ram into a wall, ending the session.
WOAH !!!

Fast forwarding by a couple of decades, in 1997, Nokia put Snake on a phone called the Nokia 6110.
Yes, the phone your father used for work purposes and you did, for playing Snake.
This was the beginning of Snake in your pocket, the game almost went viral, signalling a new era in mobile phone gaming.

Snake 2, the game loaded on the original Nokia 3310, gave the Snake an actual snake-like form, while adding bonuses you could pick up while playing.
The playing field or the board, also became cyclical, meaning you could go in through one side and appear from the other.
Lastly, mazes were added, to make the game even more challenging.
